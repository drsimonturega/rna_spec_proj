# rna_spec_proj


### reconecting git repository
```git remote set-url origin https://username:token@github.com/username/repository.git```

### cloning conda environment

To clone our conda environment we used this command ```conda env create -f env.yaml -n rna_spec_reshma```

This installed the wrong version of python so we ```conda install python=3.10.6```. This was checked with ```python --version```.
